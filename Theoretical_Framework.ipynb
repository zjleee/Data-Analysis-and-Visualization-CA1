    "üìò Theoretical Framework ‚Äì Tech Adoption Index by Country\n",
    "Technology adoption is a critical driver of national competitiveness, economic growth, and societal development. As digital infrastructure, skills, and usage patterns become more complex and interdependent, there is a growing need for a comprehensive, data-driven metric to assess how well countries are positioned to adopt and benefit from technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tech Adoption Index (TAI) aims to quantify a country's ability to adopt and integrate technology across multiple dimensions. It draws inspiration from established indices such as the World Bank‚Äôs Digital Adoption Index, UNCTAD‚Äôs B2C E-Commerce Index, and OECD indicators on digital skills and innovation. However, the TAI uniquely integrates both inputs (e.g., infrastructure, human capital) and outputs (e.g., technology exports, e-commerce participation) to produce a holistic measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç Motivation\n",
    "In an increasingly digital global economy, simply measuring access to technology (e.g., internet users) is no longer sufficient. A meaningful index must account for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure readiness (e.g., broadband availability, mobile penetration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Human capability (e.g., ICT graduates, problem solving in tech-rich environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic output and participation (e.g., tech exports, e-commerce engagement)\n",
    "\n",
    "Government and business digitization (e.g., Digital Adoption Index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Countries may have strong infrastructure but lack workforce readiness, or vice versa. The Tech Adoption Index addresses this multidimensional complexity by aggregating diverse indicators into one unified score.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìä Variable Selection Justification\n",
    "Each variable was selected based on relevance to a core pillar of technology adoption:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillar\tIndicator\tSource\n",
    "Access\tInternet Users (%), Mobile Subscriptions, Broadband Penetration\tWorld Bank\n",
    "Skills\tICT Graduates (%), Digital Problem Solving Skills\tUNESCO, OECD\n",
    "Innovation Output\tHigh-Tech Exports (USD), R&D (% of GDP)\tWorld Bank, OECD\n",
    "Digital Usage\tUNCTAD B2C E-Commerce Index, Digital Adoption Index (DAI)\tUNCTAD, World Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "All indicators are sourced from internationally recognized public databases, ensuring comparability and credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "üì¶ Index Design Considerations\n",
    "Due to the lack of access to domain experts, variable selection and weighting are based on academic research, government reports, and existing digital maturity frameworks. The indicators were preprocessed using normalization and missing data imputation. We used intersectional filtering to retain only countries with complete data across all indicators, ensuring data quality and validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining both structural readiness and realized digital outcomes, the TAI provides an actionable, cross-country benchmark for policymakers, researchers, and investors to understand digital transformation readiness.\n",
