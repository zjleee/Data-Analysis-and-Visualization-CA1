    "The goal is to develop a composite indicator that quantifies the degree of technology adoption across different countries. This index will integrate various measurable indicators into a single, comparable score per country.\n",

    "Why This Index?\n",
    "Technology adoption is crucial for economic growth, societal development, and global competitiveness. However, it involves infrastructure, access, education, usage, and innovationâ€”none of which can independently define adoption. Hence, a multidimensional index is necessary.\n",
